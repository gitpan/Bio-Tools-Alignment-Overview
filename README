Bio-Tools-Alignment-Overview

Bio-Tools-Alignment-Overview is a module designed to help people (principally biologists) working with
sequence alignments. The module produces a image file with a resumed birds-eye-view of the alignment file.

For now you can ajust the sequence color, with time new customizations will be implemented.
